### Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.  As it writes on the [Wikipedia][wiki]

>It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 
>However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. 
>Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more frequently than the core Flask program.

### Tech

Flask depends on the Jinja template engine and the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit. The documentation for these libraries can be found at:

* [Jinja] - Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Djangoâ€™s templates.
* [Werkzeug WSGI] - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.


And of course Flask itself is open source with a [public repository][Flask] on GitHub.

This readme file is created with the help of [dillinger.io][Dillinger]
